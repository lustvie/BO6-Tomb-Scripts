## 🧩 Fail-Safe (Xbox Only)
This optional feature automatically:
- Detects the reload vibration from the 9mm pistol when you’re downed  
- Self-revives, uses a **Mutant Injection**, and **Save & Quits**

⚠️ Make sure you have:
- Vibration enabled (100%)  
- Self Revive available  
- Mutant Injection equipped  

> Tested using a *Gamesir G7 SE controller* — results may vary on other hardware.

If you want, I can format your entire README (with your video + these instructions + demo section) in a clean Markdown style so you can paste it right in.  
Would you like me to do that next?
